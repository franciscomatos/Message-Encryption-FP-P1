# Message Encryption

This project is based on **Polybius square**. In this square, the letters are arranged in a matrix 5x5. The purpose of this problem is to encrypt a message replacing each letter in it with 2 digits: the line and the column of the letter in the square. The original message is obtained using the reverse process. This is a simplified version of the problem.
